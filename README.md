## :cloud: Installation

You can install the package globally and use it as command line tool:


```sh
# Using npm
npm install --global github-labeller

# Using yarn
yarn global add github-labeller
```


Then, run `github-labeller --help` and see what the CLI tool can do.


```
$ github-labeller --help
Usage: github-labeller [options]

Options:
  -r, --repo <user(/repo)>        The repository full name (e.g.
                                  ionicabizau/github-labeller) or the username.
  -t, --token <token>             The GitHub token.
  -c, --config <path>             The configuration file (a JSON file containing an
                                  array like this: [{ "color": "#4aa3df", "name":
                                  "Some label name" }]).
  -i, --import <user/repository>  Import labels from a specific repository.
  -h, --help                      Displays this help.
  -v, --version                   Displays version information.

Examples:
  github-labeller -r ionicabizau/github-labeller -t some-token -c my-labels.json
  github-labeller -r ionicabizau -i jlord/git-it-electron -t some-token # import @jlord's labels in all my projects

Documentation can be found at https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-labeller#readme
```








You also need to get a GitHub application token. Go here: https://github.com/settings/tokens. Click on <kbd>Generate New Token</kbd>. Because you will be setting labels for repositories, you will need to add the `repo` scopes. Name the token something informative: `github-labeller` is a good name.

If you would like to use this label more than once, save it somewhere in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` files. These are normally hidden in your root directory.








## :clipboard: Example



Here is an example how to use this package as library. To install it locally, as library, you can use `npm install github-labeller` (or `yarn add github-labeller`):



```js
// Dependencies
var GitHubLabeller = require("github-labeller");

// Provide the token and some info
var labeller = GitHubLabeller([
    {
        color: "#4aa3df"
      , name: "Some blue label"
    }
], {
    repo: "jlord/git-it-electron"
  , token: "your token here"
}, function (err, data) {
    if (err) {
        return console.log(err);
    }
    console.log(data);
});

labeller.on("added", function (owner, repo, label, err, data) {
    console.log(label, owner + "/" + repo);
});
```

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects
I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:


 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
